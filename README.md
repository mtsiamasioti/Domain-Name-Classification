# Domain-Name-Classification
(Kaggle Challenge)

For this challenge, we were provided with a subgraph with the Greek web graph, where
nodes correspond to domain names. More specifically, a directed edge between two nodes
indicates that there exists a hyperlink from at least one page of the source domain to at
least one page of the target domain.

Moreover, we were given the textual content of the webpages crawled from a subset
of these domain names.

Our goal is to use the above graph-theoretical and textual information that we were
given, in order to classify correctly the domain names of the test dataset into one of the 10
defined webpage categories.
